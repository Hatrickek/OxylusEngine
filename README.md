## About   
This is my hobby project that I work on in my spare time to learn more about graphics programming and engine architectures. Especially Vulkan and C++.
Also to produce some games including my dream game in the future.

Currently I'm developing [Oxrena](https://github.com/Hatrickek/Oxrena) -a quake-like movement shooter- using Oxylus!

Windows, Linux and Mac (with MoltenVK) is supported.

## Features:     
- Modular Vulkan renderer built with Vuk.
- Modern rendering features:
	- Clustered Forward IBL PBR
	- GPU Culling
	- GTAO
	- SSR
	- PCF Cascaded Directional, Spot and Point Light Shadows
	- Physically Based Bloom
	- Depth Of Field 
	- HDR
	- Tonemapping 
	- Chromatic Aberration
	- Film Grain
	- Vignette
	- Sharpen
	- and many more various post-processing effects.
- Multithreaded physics with Jolt.   
- C++ and Lua scripting API with ECS events and ECS systems. Which has been used to
build multiple games to test the API and engine in general.   
 More about that: [Oxrena](https://github.com/Hatrickek/Oxrena), [(Creating a Game With Oxylus)](https://hatrickek.github.io/blog/oxylus-first-game)
- Editor with features such as Projects, Serializable Scenes, ContentBrowser, Prefabs, Shader Hot Reloading, Entity managing, Prefabs, Inspector Panel,
Asset Manager, Material System&Editor, In-Editor Console, and a lot more QOL
features...
- 3D Audio with miniaudio

## Building
Currently supported and tested compilers are only: MSVC and Clang
- Install [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).
- Run the root CMake script with this command to generate for MSVC:       
`cmake -S . -B ./build/ -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64`      
For clang:  
`cmake -B ./build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`
- Install `directx-shader-compiler` package if required. (Only required for UNIX)
- Then run this command to build it with CMake:   
`cmake --build ./build --config Release`
